Create a Node.js application to manage a book inventory system using a Map to store book details. Implement the following functionalities using the readline module for input:

a. Add a book with a unique ID, title, author, and genre. If the book ID already exists, print an error message. 

b. Remove a book using its ID. If the book is not found, print an error message. 

c. Search for books by title, author, genre, or ID, and print the matching results. 

d. Update the title, author, and/or genre of a book using its ID. If the book is not found, print an error message. 

e. Print a summary report of all books in the inventory, displaying their ID, title, author, genre, and quantity (if applicable). 

f. Implement an option to exit the system gracefully after performing the required operations.
